In this lesson, we’ll learn how to import and work with data stored in a Google Sheet. Google Sheets are popular because they’re free, easy to share, and cloud-based, which makes them a convenient way to publish and access data.

## When to Use a Google Sheet

Google Sheets are useful when you want to work with data that is shared online and updated regularly. They can be used much like CSV files once you generate the correct link.

To load a Google Sheet into Python, the sheet must be set to **Anyone with the link can view**. Then the URL is adjusted so it ends with:

```
/export?format=csv
```

This tells Pandas to treat the Google Sheet as if it were a CSV file.

### Step 1 — Import Libraries and Load Google Sheet Data

In this step, we bring in the tools we need (`pandas` for working with tables, `plotly.express` for charts) and load a dataset directly from a Google Sheet link.

```{python}
# Setup
import plotly.express as px
import pandas as pd

# Input: Read the Google Sheet (shared as CSV) into a DataFrame
url = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZULKhYzsMd4eYwiprsyGgE9Df3gaVtO8WRalUQDn-xE/export?format=csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)
```

### Step 2 — Preview the Data

As always, it’s good to take a quick look at the data to confirm it is loaded correctly.

```{python}
# Preview the first few rows
df.head()
```

Check that the columns and rows appear as expected.

### Step 3 — Plot the Data

Once the data is loaded, plotting works the same way as with CSV or Excel files.

```{python}
# Create a line plot
px.line(df, x="X", y="Y", title="Data from a Google Sheet")
```

## Talk About It

* Why might someone choose to share data in a Google Sheet instead of a CSV or Excel file?
* What are the advantages of being able to update a dataset online (like in a Google Sheet) compared to using a static file?
* What potential issues could you run into when working with shared Google Sheets?

## Lesson Notebook

Now it’s your turn to practice: The notebook version of this lesson includes exercises where you’ll load real basketball data from Google Sheets and create your own plots.
