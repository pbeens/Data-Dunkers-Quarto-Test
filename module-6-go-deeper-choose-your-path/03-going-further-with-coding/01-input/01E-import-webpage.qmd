In this lesson, we’ll learn how to import and work with data stored in an HTML table on a webpage. Many websites publish statistics or datasets in tables, and with Python we can bring those tables directly into our code.

## When to Use a Webpage

One common use for webpages in data analysis is when they include tables — for example, sports stats, government data, or league standings. Pandas can read these tables directly from the page’s URL, saving time compared to copying and pasting.

The main difference from CSV or Excel is that webpages can have multiple tables. Pandas assigns an index to each table, starting at zero, and you choose the one you need.

### Step 1 — Import Libraries and Load Webpage Data

In this step, we bring in the tools we need (`pandas` for working with tables, `plotly.express` for charts) and load a dataset directly from a webpage.

```{python}
# Setup
import plotly.express as px
import pandas as pd

# Input: Read the first table from the webpage into a DataFrame
url = "https://github.com/Data-Dunkers/data/raw/refs/heads/main/demo/x-y-data.html"
df = pd.read_html(url)[0]   # Index 0 means the first table on the page
```

### Step 2 — Preview the Data

Check that the data was loaded correctly.

```{python}
# Preview the first few rows
df.head()
```

Confirm that the columns and rows line up with the table you expected.

### Step 3 — Plot the Data

Once the table is loaded, we can plot it just like any other DataFrame.

```{python}
# Create a line plot
px.line(df, x="X", y="Y", title="Data from a Webpage Table")
```

## Talk About It

* Why might it be useful to load data directly from a webpage instead of downloading it first?
* What challenges could you face if a webpage has multiple tables?
* What risks come with relying on webpages for data (for example, if the site changes its layout)?

## Lesson Notebook

Now it’s your turn to practice: The notebook version of this lesson includes exercises where you’ll load and visualize data from webpages.
