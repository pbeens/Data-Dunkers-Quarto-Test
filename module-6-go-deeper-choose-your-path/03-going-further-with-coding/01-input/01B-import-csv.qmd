Load a shared or local **CSV** using `pd.read_csv(...)`, then take a quick look at shape, column names, and a few rows to confirm what came in before moving on.  

Corresponds with the lesson at: [https://github.com/Data-Dunkers/lessons/blob/main/data-from-csv.ipynb](https://github.com/Data-Dunkers/lessons/blob/main/data-from-csv.ipynb).
