In this lesson, we’ll learn how to create bar graphs in Python using Plotly Express. Bar graphs are a simple but powerful way to compare values across categories, such as a player’s stats from one season to another.

## When to Use Bar Graphs

Bar graphs are useful when you want to compare quantities side by side. For example, we might compare Pascal Siakam’s field goals made in different seasons, or look at field goals made versus attempted.

### Step 1 — Import Libraries and Load Data

We’ll use Pandas to load Pascal Siakam’s data from a CSV file into a DataFrame.

```{python}
# Setup
import pandas as pd

# Input: Load Pascal Siakam's data into a DataFrame
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pbeens/Data-Dunkers/main/Data/Pascal_Siakam.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)

# Reduce the DataFrame to essential columns
columns = ["SEASON_ID", "FGM", "FGA"]
df = df[columns]

# Keep only seasons up to 2022–23
df = df[df["SEASON_ID"] <= "2022-23"]

# Preview the first few rows
df.head()
```

### Step 2 — Create a Simple Bar Graph

We’ll use the Plotly Express function `px.bar()` to create a basic bar graph of field goals made by season.

```{python}
import plotly.express as px

# Bar graph of field goals made by season
px.bar(df, x="SEASON_ID", y="FGM", title="Siakam Field Goals by Season")
```

### Step 3 — Customize Axis Labels

We can improve readability by adding custom axis labels.

```{python}
# Add custom axis labels
px.bar(
    df, x="SEASON_ID", y="FGM",
    title="Siakam Field Goals by Season"
).update_xaxes(title="Season").update_yaxes(title="Field Goals Made")
```

### Step 4 — Horizontal Bar Graphs

If we prefer a horizontal bar graph, we can switch the orientation.

```{python}
# Horizontal bar graph
px.bar(df, x="FGM", y="SEASON_ID", orientation="h", title="Siakam Field Goals by Season")
```

### Step 5 — Compare Multiple Columns

We can compare multiple values, such as field goals made (`FGM`) and field goals attempted (`FGA`), by plotting them together.

```{python}
# Grouped bar graph of field goals made and attempted
px.bar(
    df, x="SEASON_ID", y=["FGM", "FGA"],
    barmode="group",
    title="Siakam Field Goals Made vs Attempted by Season"
)
```

## Talk About It

* Why might a bar graph be more effective than a table for showing differences between seasons?
* When would a horizontal bar graph be more useful than a vertical one?
* What insights can you gain by comparing field goals made and attempted side by side?
