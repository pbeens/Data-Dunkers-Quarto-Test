In this lesson, we’ll learn how to create line graphs and scatter plots with Plotly Express. Both help us explore relationships in data — line graphs show trends over time, while scatter plots compare two variables.

## When to Use Line or Scatter Plots

* Use a **line graph** when you want to show how something changes across time or ordered categories (like seasons).  
* Use a **scatter plot** when you want to examine the relationship between two variables (like field goals attempted vs. field goals made).  

### Step 1 — Import Libraries and Load Data

We’ll use Pandas to load Pascal Siakam’s data, then reduce it to just the columns we need for this lesson: season, field goals made, field goals attempted, assists, and points.

```{python}
# Setup
import pandas as pd

# Input: Load Pascal Siakam's data into a DataFrame
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pbeens/Data-Dunkers/main/Data/Pascal_Siakam.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)

# Keep only seasons up to 2022–23
df = df[df["SEASON_ID"] <= "2022-23"]

# Reduce to essential columns
df = df[["SEASON_ID", "FGM", "FGA", "AST", "PTS"]]

# Preview the first few rows
df.head()
```

### Step 2 — Line Graphs

We can create a line graph of field goals made by season.

```{python}
import plotly.express as px

# Line graph of field goals made by season
px.line(df, x="SEASON_ID", y="FGM", title="Siakam Field Goals by Season")
```

### Step 3 — Scatter Plots

Scatter plots compare two numeric variables. Here we compare field goals attempted versus field goals made.

```{python}
# Scatter plot of field goals attempted vs made
px.scatter(df, x="FGA", y="FGM", title="Siakam Field Goals vs Attempts")
```

### Step 4 — Adding More Information

We can color the points by season and scale them by assists (`AST`) to show more dimensions.

```{python}
# Scatter plot with color and size
px.scatter(
    df,
    x="FGA",
    y="FGM",
    color="SEASON_ID",
    size="AST",
    title="Siakam Field Goals vs Attempts (Colored by Season, Sized by Assists)"
)
```

### Step 5 — Adding a Trendline

A trendline helps us see the overall relationship between variables.

```{python}
# Scatter plot with a trendline
px.scatter(
    df,
    x="FGA",
    y="FGM",
    trendline="ols",
    title="Trendline: Field Goals Made vs Attempts"
)
```

## Talk About It

* When is a line graph more useful than a scatter plot?
* What patterns do you notice in field goals made compared to attempts?
* How does adding a trendline change the way you interpret the data?
