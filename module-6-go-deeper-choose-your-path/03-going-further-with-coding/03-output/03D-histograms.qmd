In this lesson, we’ll learn how to create histograms with Plotly Express. Histograms help us visualize the distribution of a variable by grouping values into ranges (called *bins*).

## When to Use Histograms

Histograms are useful when you want to see how data is spread out — for example, which shooting percentages are most common among players. They’re especially helpful for identifying clusters, gaps, or outliers in the data.

### Step 1 — Import Libraries and Load Data

We’ll use Pandas to load the 2023 Raptors dataset, then keep only the columns we need: player, age, and field goal percentage.

```{python}
# Setup
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

# Input: Load the 2023 Raptors dataset
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Data-Dunkers/data/main/NBA/raptors-2023.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)

# Reduce to essential columns
df = df[["Player", "Age", "FG%"]]

# Preview the first few rows
df.head()
```

### Step 2 — Create a Simple Histogram

A histogram shows how values are distributed across bins. Here we’ll look at field goal percentage (`FG%`).

```{python}
px.histogram(df, x="FG%", title="Raptors Field Goal Percentage")
```

### Step 3 — Adjust the Number of Bins

We can change the number of bins to get a clearer picture of the distribution.

```{python}
px.histogram(df, x="FG%", nbins=15, title="Raptors Field Goal Percentage (15 Bins)")
```

### Step 4 — Add Another Variable with Color

We can add more detail by coloring the bars according to another column, such as `Age`.

```{python}
px.histogram(df, x="FG%", color="Age", title="Raptors Field Goal Percentage by Age")
```

## Talk About It

* How does changing the number of bins affect the way you see the data distribution?
* What insights can you get from looking at a histogram that you might not notice in a table of numbers?
* Why might adding color (for example, by age) make the histogram more informative?
