This path builds on what you’ve already learned: you’ll bring in data in different ways, work with it (filter, sort, compute), and then turn it into clear visuals that help you notice patterns and stories.

In thinking about this work, one helpful model is **Input → Process → Output**. It reminds us that any data task involves three stages:

- **Input**: how data gets into your program or tool  
- **Process**: how you clean, transform, or filter that data  
- **Output**: how you visualize or present what you’ve learned  

Use this model to guide your learning in this section — it helps you see why each step matters before moving on.

## [Input Methods](01-input/index.qmd)

Explore different ways to **bring data into your coding environment**: using internal data structures, CSV, Excel, Google Sheets, or pulling tables from web pages. 

*Corresponds with the following lessons:*  
Data‑from‑internal • data‑from‑csv • data‑from‑excel • data‑from‑google‑sheet • data‑from‑webpage (in the Data‑Dunkers lessons repo)

## [Process Data](02-process/index.qmd)

Learn how to **shape your data**: choose columns, apply filters, sort rows, add new computed columns, and use quick summary statistics so you understand your data before graphing.

*Corresponds with the following lessons:*  
data‑columns • data‑filtering • data‑sorting • data‑new‑columns • data‑statistics

## [Output Visualizations](03-output/index.qmd)

Convert cleaned data into visuals that highlight insights and comparisons: bar graphs, line and scatter plots, pie charts, histograms, etc.

*Corresponds with the following lessons:*  
graphing‑bar‑graphs • graphing‑scatter‑plots • graphing‑pie‑charts • graphing‑histograms
