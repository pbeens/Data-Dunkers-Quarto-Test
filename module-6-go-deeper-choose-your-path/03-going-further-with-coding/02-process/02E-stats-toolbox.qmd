In this lesson, we’ll learn how to use Pandas to calculate some basic statistics that help summarize data quickly. Statistics like minimum, maximum, mean, and median can tell us a lot about a dataset at a glance.

## When to Use Statistics

Statistics are useful whenever you want to describe a dataset in just a few numbers. Instead of looking through every row, you can use these tools to find patterns and compare values.

### Step 1 — Import Libraries and Load Data

We’ll use Pandas to load Raptors team data from a CSV file into a DataFrame.

```{python}
# Setup
import pandas as pd

# Input: Load Raptors 2023 season data
url = "https://github.com/Data-Dunkers/data/raw/refs/heads/main/NBA/raptors-2023.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)

# Reduce the DataFrame to essential columns
columns = ["Player", "Age", "G", "FG%", "PTS"]
df_small = df[columns]

# Preview
df_small.head()
```

### Step 2 — Calculate Basic Statistics

We can calculate the minimum, maximum, mean, and median of a column using built-in functions.

```{python}
# Calculate statistics for the 'G' (Games Played) column
print("Minimum =", df_small["G"].min())
print("Maximum =", df_small["G"].max())
print("Median =", int(df_small["G"].median()))
print("Mean =", df_small["G"].mean().round(1))
```

Notice how we used `round(1)` to round the mean to one decimal place, and `int()` to make the median a whole number.

### Step 3 — Generate Statistics for All Columns

If you want to see more, the `.describe()` function gives a full summary of statistics for all numeric columns.

```{python}
# Generate summary statistics for all numeric columns
df_small.describe().round(2)
```

This includes count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, quartiles, and maximum for each numeric column.

## Talk About It

* Why might you want to calculate statistics instead of looking through raw data?
* How does rounding make the results easier to understand?
* When would a full `.describe()` summary be more useful than focusing on one column?
