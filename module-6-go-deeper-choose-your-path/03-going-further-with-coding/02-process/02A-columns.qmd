title: "Selecting Columns for Analysis"
format: html
---

Students **load a real NBA player CSV** into a DataFrame, explore what each column represents, and practice **selecting specific fields** for analysis. They also use a short `for` loop to iterate through `df.columns`, building familiarity with the datasetâ€™s structure so they can target the right variables later. 

Corresponds with the lesson at: [https://github.com/Data-Dunkers/lessons/blob/main/data-columns.ipynb](https://github.com/Data-Dunkers/lessons/blob/main/data-columns.ipynb).
