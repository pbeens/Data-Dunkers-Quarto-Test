In this lesson, we’ll learn how to work with columns in a Pandas DataFrame. Columns represent the different variables or measurements in your dataset (like points scored, rebounds, or field goals made).

## When to Work With Columns 

Often we don’t need an entire dataset — we just want to focus on certain variables. Pandas makes it easy to list all available columns, access specific ones, and even select multiple columns at once.

### Step 1 — Import Libraries and Load Data

We’ll use Pandas to load Pascal Siakam’s basketball data from a CSV file into a DataFrame.

```{python}
# Setup
import pandas as pd

# Input: Load data into a DataFrame
url = "https://github.com/Data-Dunkers/data/raw/refs/heads/main/NBA/Pascal_Siakam.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)

# Preview the first few rows
df.head()
```

### Step 2 — View the Columns

You can see which columns are available by using the `.columns` attribute.

```{python}
# List all the columns
df.columns
```

You can also use a Python `for loop` to print them one at a time.

```{python}
# Print each column name
for column in df.columns:
    print(column)
```

### Step 3 — Select Specific Columns

Once you know the column names, you can focus on the ones you want.

```{python}
# Select a single column
df["FGM"]
```

```{python}
# Select multiple columns
df[["FGM", "FGA"]]
```

This way you can zoom in on field goals made (FGM) and attempted (FGA) without looking at the rest of the dataset.

## Talk About It

* Why might you want to look at only a few columns instead of the entire dataset?
* How does being able to list all the columns help you as a data analyst?
* If a dataset has dozens of columns, how might you decide which ones are most important for your analysis?

## Lesson Notebook

Now it’s your turn to practice: The notebook version of this lesson includes exercises where you’ll explore columns, filter for specific stats, and practice selecting multiple fields.
