title: "Filtering the Data"
format: html

Keep only the rows that matter using **boolean masks** and readable conditions (e.g., `df["Distance"] >= 6`, `df["Player"].isin([...])`). Emphasis is on clear, chainable filters students will reuse in later charts and comparisons. 

Corresponds with the lesson at: [https://github.com/Data-Dunkers/lessons/blob/main/data-filtering.ipynb](https://github.com/Data-Dunkers/lessons/blob/main/data-filtering.ipynb).
