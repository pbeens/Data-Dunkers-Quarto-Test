title: "Creating New Columns"
format: html
---

Create **derived fields** with vectorized formulas and simple conditionsâ€”e.g., shooting **percentage** from Makes/Attempts, and **distance buckets** (Short/Medium/Long). These metrics power richer comparisons and will feed directly into visualizations. 

Corresponds with the lesson at: [https://github.com/Data-Dunkers/lessons/blob/main/data-new-columns.ipynb](https://github.com/Data-Dunkers/lessons/blob/main/data-new-columns.ipynb).
