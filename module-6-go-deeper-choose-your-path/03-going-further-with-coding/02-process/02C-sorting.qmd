title: "Sorting the Data"
format: html

Surface patterns by ordering rows with `df.sort_values(...)`: sort by one column, then by **multiple keys** (e.g., `["Player","Distance"]`), and control ascending/descending for consistent, reproducible tables. 

Corresponds with the lesson at: [https://github.com/Data-Dunkers/lessons/blob/main/data-sorting.ipynb](https://github.com/Data-Dunkers/lessons/blob/main/data-sorting.ipynb).
