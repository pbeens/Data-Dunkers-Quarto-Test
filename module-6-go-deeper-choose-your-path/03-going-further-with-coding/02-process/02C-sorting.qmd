In this lesson, we’ll learn how to sort data in a Pandas DataFrame. Sorting helps us organize information, making it easier to compare values and spot patterns.

## When to Sort Data

Sorting is useful when we want to find the highest or lowest values in a dataset or to arrange rows in a meaningful order. For example, we could sort by points scored to see a player’s best seasons first.

### Step 1 — Import Libraries and Load Data

We’ll use Pandas to load Pascal Siakam’s basketball data from a CSV file into a DataFrame, then narrow it down to a smaller set of essential columns so it’s easier to work with.

```{python}
# Setup
import pandas as pd

# Input: Load Pascal Siakam's data into a DataFrame
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pbeens/Data-Dunkers/main/Data/Pascal_Siakam.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)

# Reduce the DataFrame to essential columns
columns = ["SEASON_ID", "TEAM_ABBREVIATION", "GP", "GS", "MIN", "FGM", "FGA", "STL", "BLK"]
df_small = df[columns]

# Preview the first few rows
df_small.head()
```

### Step 2 — Sort by a Single Column

We can sort the DataFrame by steals (`STL`). By default, sorting is ascending (lowest to highest).

```{python}
# Sort by steals in ascending order
df_small.sort_values("STL")
```

To sort in descending order (highest to lowest), add `ascending=False`.

```{python}
# Sort by steals in descending order
df_small.sort_values("STL", ascending=False)
```

### Step 3 — Sort by Multiple Columns

We can also sort by more than one column. For example, first by blocks (`BLK`) and then by steals (`STL`).

```{python}
# Sort by blocks first, then steals
df_small.sort_values(["BLK", "STL"])
```

## Talk About It

* Why is sorting a useful tool in data analysis?
* When would you want ascending order, and when would descending order make more sense?
* How could sorting by multiple columns give you a deeper understanding of the data?
