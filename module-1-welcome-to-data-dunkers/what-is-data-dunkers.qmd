Data isn’t just for scientists or statisticians — it’s becoming a core skill for success in almost every career. Whether in sports, healthcare, engineering, or creative industries, the ability to understand and use data is a game-changer for students’ futures.

The World Economic Forum lists data analysis and data science among the most in-demand skills in their Future of Jobs report, with demand only expected to grow in the years ahead.

**Why it matters for us as educators:** Data science isn’t just about numbers — it’s about curiosity, problem-solving, and storytelling.
