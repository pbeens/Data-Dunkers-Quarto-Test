title: "Align Activities to Curriculum and Student Goals"

One of the most powerful ways to make Data Dunkers stick in your classroom is to connect each activity to **explicit curriculum expectations**. This ensures the time spent on basketball data is not just fun, but also advancing mandated learning outcomes.

In this section, we will:

- Identify links between Data Dunkers activities and the **Ontario Mathematics Curriculum**.  
- Show how the same activity can align differently depending on grade level.  
- Provide concrete examples so you can confidently justify your choices.  

## Why Curriculum Alignment Matters

Curriculum alignment makes it clear that:

- Data Dunkers is not an “add-on,” but a **vehicle for meeting existing math goals**.  
- Students build transferable skills — working with data, coding, and problem-solving — while engaging with basketball.  
- You can integrate Data Dunkers into units on **data literacy, algebra, or financial literacy** without rewriting your whole program.  

## Curriculum Connections by Grade

### Grade 9 (2021 Curriculum)

**Strand D: Data**  

- *D1.2* Represent and statistically analyse data from a real-life situation involving a single variable in various ways (e.g., quartile values, box plots).  
  → Data Dunkers: Students calculate shot success rates and visualize them using bar charts and box plots.  

- *D1.3* Create a scatter plot to represent the relationship between two variables and test regression models.  
  → Data Dunkers: Students compare shooting percentage to distance, fit a line of best fit, and interpret the trend.  

**Strand C: Algebra (Coding Integration)**  

- *C2.2* Create code by decomposing situations into computational steps in order to represent mathematical concepts and relationships.  
  → Data Dunkers: Students use Python notebooks to filter and sort basketball data, then generate plots automatically.  

### Grade 10 (2005 Curriculum)

**Linear Relations Strand**  

- Collect data, graph it, determine the equation of a line of best fit, and use it to solve problems.  
  → Data Dunkers: Students use scatter plots of shot success vs. distance, then apply line of best fit to predict outcomes.  

**Data Management Strand**  

- Use data management techniques to investigate relationships and solve problems.  
  → Data Dunkers: Students summarize player stats and use averages/percentages to compare performance.  

### Grades 11–12 (2007 Curriculum)

**Mathematics of Data Management (MDM4U)**  

- Organize data using charts, tables, and graphs.  
- Apply measures of central tendency and variability to analyze sets of data.  
  → Data Dunkers: Students create multi-variable dashboards (e.g., shooting accuracy by quarter, by player, by distance).  

**Foundations for College Mathematics (MAP4C / MBF3C)**  

- Collect, display, and analyze data involving one or two variables.  
- Interpret statistical measures in context.  
  → Data Dunkers: Students design and present infographics summarizing team statistics.  

## Classroom Example

> *Example*: A Grade 9 class collects shot data from a free-throw drill. Students record makes/misses in a spreadsheet, import it into a Jupyter notebook, and produce a bar graph of success rates.  
>
> - Curriculum Link: **Grade 9, D1.2 (Data Representation)**.  
> - Extension: Fit a trend line to success vs. shot distance (**Grade 9, D1.3**) and compare it to the theoretical model (**Grade 10 Linear Relations**).  

## Your Turn

Reflect on your own teaching context:  

- Which Data Dunkers activities align with **your grade level**?  
- Which curriculum strands are you already required to cover that Data Dunkers could bring to life?  
- How might you present these connections to your students and administrators?
