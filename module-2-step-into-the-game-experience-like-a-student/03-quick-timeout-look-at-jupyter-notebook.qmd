title: "Quick Timeout: Look at Jupyter Notebook"
format: html

Before we get into our first **BIG** activity, we’re going to step out of the student role for a moment and give you, as a teacher, a quick look at one of the tools we’ll be using.

We usually embed this learning into the experience with the students, but we wanted to provide you with a greater explanation up front.

Watch this short video explaining how **Jupyter Notebooks** work. We’ll use these for the next two activities, so this quick overview will help you understand how they’re set up and how you and your students can interact with them.

We’ve also included [a link to a sample notebook](https://github.com/Data-Dunkers/lessons/blob/main/jupyter-notebook-demo.ipynb) to an external site. that contains some of the information we’ll discuss in the video — so you can actually try out the notebook environment for yourself.
